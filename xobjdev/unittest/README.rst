Build Instructions
==================

Building this DLL requires a DOS/Windows 3.1 environment. DOSBox is recommended.

Install Director for Windows 4.0.4 and Microsoft Visual C++ 1.52.

Copy this folder into the C:\DIRECTOR\XOBJDEV directory.

From a DOS prompt, run the following: 

C:\MSVC\BIN\MSVCVARS.BAT
cd C:\DIRECTOR\XOBJDEV\UNITTEST
nmake

This will produce an XObject file, UNITTEST.DLL.
